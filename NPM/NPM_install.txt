# we don't upload node_modules folder inside github because modules folder is heavy in size and is not ideal to upload we only upload code we write and re-install node dependencies via "npm install" using package.json file.

To install the dependencies specified in package.json, use the command npm install in the directory where the package.json file is located. This will create a node_modules directory in the current directory and install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

If you want to install dependencies from another directory, you can use the npm link command to create a symbolic link to the node_modules directory in the target directory. For example:

npm link /path/to/node_modules
